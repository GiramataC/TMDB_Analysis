# TMDB Movie Analysis Pipeline

A data pipeline that fetches, cleans, analyses, and visualizes movie data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API.

## Set up

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd TMDB_Analysis
```

### Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set up your API key

You can get a free API key from [https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)

### Configure movie IDs
Edit `config.py` to set the list of TMDB movie IDs you want to fetch:
```python
MOVIE_IDS = [299536, 19995, 140607, ...]
```

---

## How to Run

### Run the full pipeline
```bash
python main.py
```
This will:
1. Fetch movie data from the TMDB API
2. Clean and preprocess the data
3. Engineer KPI features
4. Print analysis results to the terminal
5. Display visualizations

### Run the notebook for interactive exploration
```bash
jupyter notebook TMDB.ipynb
```

## Pipeline Overview

| File                | Purpose                                                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Data_retrieval.py` | Fetches movie details and credits from TMDB API with retry logic |
| `Data_cleaning.py`  | Cleans raw data, flattens nested fields, handles missing values |
| `Analysis.py`       | KPI engineering, ranking, filtering, and aggregation queries |
| `visualisation.py`  | Matplotlib charts for revenue, ROI, popularity, and franchise analysis |
| `main.py`           | Orchestrates the full pipeline end to end |
| `config.py`         | Stores movie IDs and pipeline configuration constants |
| `TMDB.ipynb`        | Interactive notebook for exploring results |

## Features

- Fetches movie metadata and credits in a single API call using `append_to_response`
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for failed API requests
- Handles nested JSON fields like genres, cast, and production companies
- Computes KPIs: profit, ROI, budget and revenue in millions
- Flexible ranking and filtering system supporting numeric and string conditions
- Franchise vs standalone performance comparison
- Top directors and franchises by revenue
- Visualizations: revenue vs budget, ROI by genre, popularity vs rating, yearly trends

---

## Logs

Pipeline logs are saved to `logs/movie_pipeline.log` and also printed to the terminal during each run.

---

## Notes

- The `.env` file is excluded from version control via `.gitignore` — never commit your API key
- Raw data is saved as both `.parquet` and `.csv` for flexibility
- Always run `main.py` first before opening the notebook to ensure data is up to date
